### Summary 
Emergency settings create unique challenges for the delivery of clinical care according to WHO’s recommended guidelines. 

<a href="https://www.who.int/tools/CCC">Clinical Care in Crises</a> (CCC) is one of WHO’s responses to the current situation. It is a digital platform which delivers clinical decision support to frontline health workers in emergency settings. 

Our vision is to improve health outcomes in emergencies by making WHO’s established clinical guidelines available whenever, wherever and by whomever.​ To achieve this Clinical Care in Crises will create a digital solution for healthcare workers using WHO’s SMART guidelines ​to better serve maternal and child care in an emergency setting

Project objectives:

* Be a digital platform through which WHO recommendations can be delivered at the point of care and regularly updated  
* Initially improve health outcomes for mothers and children in emergency settings by presenting IMCI in a digital format. This will be expanded to more age groups and health conditions in the future
* Ensure that IMCI digital content is made available to frontline health workers via a mobile reference app, maintaining fidelity with original guidance
* Promote a modular, reusable ecosystem to which member states and external partners can collaborate and contribute

Health care workers can use the Frontline app on their tablet or mobile phone to access WHO guidance at the point of care and better assess, treat and/or refer a patient. The aim is to improve the quality of clinical care and, ultimately, lead to better patient outcomes. 

Clinical Care in Crises promotes a modular, reusable ecosystem to which member states and external partners can contribute. It ensures the digital content maintains fidelity with original WHO guidance, whilst also making appropriate adaptations to emergency settings. 

### L1 Narrative guidelines
The current phase of the CCC project focuses on reducing mortality in emergency settings in three priority areas:

1. integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) 
2. malnutrition, and 
3. newborn care  
 
These will act as the pathfinder for expansion to more age groups and health conditions in a second phase.
